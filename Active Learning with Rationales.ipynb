Never Say Never Again is called unofficial because the company that made the other James Bond movies didn t make this one. Never Say Never Again is also a remake of the 1965 007 movie Thunderball  there are several differences in Never Say Never Again that lets you know it wasn t made by EON. One thing is that the opening is different  there s no gun barrel sequence and no pre-credit sequence  another difference is the music score. Some things in this movie does feel like a James Bond movie like the gadgets and cars  plus James Bond always getting it on with the ladies and the film does have an opening credits song. Sean Connery still does a great job playing Bond  the acting from the other stars is also great.  br    br   Never Say Never Again is a good film that s just has entertaining as the official James Bond films.

       "    'fields': {'content': ['The goal of any James Bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy  step into the shoes of Agent 007.  FRWL  comes closer to this goal than any other game  because this time you control the real James Bond. No offense to Pierce Brosnan  who made a fantastic Bond and loaned his voice and likeness to  EON   but Sean Connery was the original James Bond  and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool. br    br   I must say at this point  like many others who have reviewed this game  that Sean 70 year old voice doesn t fit his 30 year old image on screen  and this takes some getting used to  but it s certainly worth it. He makes lines like  Bond James Bond  and  Shaken  not stirred  into a big deal again. But controlling Sir Sean as he takes on the evil organization known as OCTOPUS is  as Bond said in  Octopussy    only the tip of the tentacle.  The awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel. It s the original gun barrel from the movies. Then you take on first mission  rescuing the Prime Minister s hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at Parliament  and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro. The world of the game is truly the world of the original James Bond  right down to the classic rock-n-roll rendition of the James Bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game  as Bond infiltrates a secret factory. br    br   After the game s opening  the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie  FRWL.  James Bond is sent to Turkey to retrieve a Lektor device from a Russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him. In Turkey  Bond teams up with lovable sidekick Kerim Bey. Bond must retrieve the device  protect the damsel in distress  and get both safely back to London. Bond screenwriter Bruce Feirstein worked on the script  and he s done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie. The characters from the movie are all recreated well  but some are better than others. The impersonators voicing villains Rosa Klebb and Red Grant are uncanny. And there s a moment early on in the game where you interact with a Miss Moneypenny  M  and Q who all look and behave as they did in the original Sean Connery 007 movies. br    br   What puts this game miles ahead of the other Bond games  besides Sir Sean s voice and likeness  is two notable features in the game play. One is Bond focus. While you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other  an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots Bond would shoot at  such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death. The other notable feature is the stealth and mle kills. When you re in close enough range  just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only Sean Connery s James Bond displayed. br    br   Sean Connery s Bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent  so you only have a few gadgets  but they re good ones. The Q-copter is a remote control helicopter that can self-destruct and explore areas Bond can t reach  like the Q-spider in  EON   only better. The classic laser watch is useful  not just for getting into sealed rooms  but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available. Sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with  but you must experience them for yourself. Besides the gadgets  you can go dress Bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game  including the gray suit from the movie  the standard black tuxedo  a retro stealth suit  and that classic white tuxedo  all which look exactly like they did when Sir Sean wore them in the movies. When you drive in the game  you drive the Aston Martin DB5 straight out of  Goldfinger.  It can t turn invisible  but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie. And when you re not flying down the streets of Istanbul in the  Goldinger  car  you can fly through the air in the  Thunderball  jet pack. br    br   Then there s the multi-player. Of course  it has to be compared to the standard of the  GoldenEye  game  and it fails. Also  you can only play Bond villains rather than Bond himself or the other heroes of the game. But the multi-player is amusing  and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing. The basic game does have other flaws. Some of the movie s most exciting moments  particularly the gypsy camp shootout  Bond s brawl with Red Grant on the Orient Express  and a confrontation between Bond and Rosa Klebb s bladed shoe  aren t done justice in game form. And the game is a fast play  even on the hardest difficulty. But overall  this game is the best James Bond experience so far.'],\n",

       "    'fields': {'content': ['This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series  and it is a standalone film  it is very well done. Enticing Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius  as was titling the movie in a way that references his past vow to not play Bond again. Connery was as great as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. The script is outstanding  as are the photography and the performances. It s the earliest movie I recall with Kim Basinger  who became much more famous after this film  Barbara Carrera was excellent  and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to the aging of Bond and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets equaled those of the other Bond films. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme  which  of course  could not be used by this competing production. It was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent James Bond movies released in the same year  this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80 s were the first heyday of such things  and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie. The film is actually a different version of Thunderball  updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repeated theme  there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining. I will watch this one frequently.'],\n",

He s neurotic  paranoid  an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. This is perfect break for him  even so much as to make fun of the bond icon.  I m a mess  a parody of myself  he says. It doesn t get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is very much how Ian Fleming had portrayed James Bond. Personally I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fit the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with  as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its great to see Brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall. A shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with. It s an impressive portrayal  and having Greg Kinear to ground him  is just poetic. This movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in  My Blue Heaven   but more genuine in their coping mechanisms.'],\n",
